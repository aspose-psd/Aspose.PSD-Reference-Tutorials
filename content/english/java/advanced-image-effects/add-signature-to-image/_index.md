## Introduction

In the vast world of Java development, incorporating signatures into images has become a common requirement. Aspose.PSD for Java emerges as a powerful tool, providing developers with seamless solutions for manipulating images, including the addition of signatures. In this tutorial, we will explore step by step how to add a signature to an image using Aspose.PSD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library downloaded and set up in your Java project.

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java class:

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Graphics;
import static com.aspose.psd.GraphicsUnit.Point;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.Point;

import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PngOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load Primary and Secondary Images

Create instances of the `Image` class and load both the primary and secondary images:

```java
//ExStart:LoadImages
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the primary image
Image canvas = Image.load(dataDir + "layers.psd");

// Load the secondary image containing the signature graphics
Image signature = Image.load(dataDir + "sample.psd");
//ExEnd:LoadImages
```

## Step 2: Initialize Graphics Class

Create an instance of the `Graphics` class and initialize it using the object of the primary image:

```java
//ExStart:InitializeGraphics
Graphics graphics = new Graphics(canvas);
//ExEnd:InitializeGraphics
```

## Step 3: Add Signature to Image

Use the `DrawImage` method to add the signature to the primary image. Adjust the location as needed. In this example, we attempt to place the secondary image at the right bottom of the primary image:

```java
//ExStart:AddSignatureToImage
graphics.drawImage(signature, new Point(canvas.getHeight() - signature.getHeight(), canvas.getWidth() - signature.getWidth()));
canvas.save(dataDir + "AddSignatureToImage_out.png", new PngOptions());
//ExEnd:AddSignatureToImage
```

Repeat these steps in your Java application to seamlessly add a signature to an image using Aspose.PSD.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Aspose.PSD for Java simplifies the process of adding signatures to images, enhancing the functionality of Java applications dealing with graphical content. By following this tutorial, you can effortlessly integrate signature manipulation features into your projects.
