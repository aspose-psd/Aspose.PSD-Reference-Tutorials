## Introduction

Aspose.PSD for Java is a feature-rich library that allows developers to work seamlessly with PSD files, performing various image processing tasks. In this tutorial, we'll focus on the essential steps to load images from a stream using Aspose.PSD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages include:

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.Conversion;

import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PngOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.FileMode;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.FileStream;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.MemoryStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Ensure you have a designated directory for your documents. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the code with the actual path.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Define Source and Destination Paths

Specify the path of your PSD file as the source and the desired output path for the resulting image.

```java
String sourceFile = dataDir + "sample.psd";
String destName = dataDir + "result.png";
```

## Step 3: Create Input Stream and Load Image

Initialize a FileInputStream and load the PSD file into an Image object.

```java
FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(sourceFile);
Image image = Image.load(inputStream);
```

## Step 4: Convert Image to PsdImage

If the loaded image is not a PSD image, convert it to a PsdImage.

```java
PsdImage psdImage = (PsdImage)image;
```

## Step 5: Save Image to Stream with PNG Options

Create a FileOutputStream and save the PsdImage to the desired destination using PNG options.

```java
FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(destName);
psdImage.save(outputStream, new PngOptions());
```

Congratulations! You have successfully loaded an image from a stream using Aspose.PSD for Java.
