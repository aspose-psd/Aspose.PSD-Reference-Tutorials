## Introduction

Are you ready to enhance your image processing capabilities in Java? Look no further than Aspose.PSD for Java. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of saving images using worker threads, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. Let's dive into the world of multi-threaded image processing with Aspose.PSD!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
- A development environment set up with Java.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, begin by importing the necessary packages for working with Aspose.PSD:

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.Conversion;

import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.ImageOptionsBase;
import com.aspose.psd.coreexceptions.OperationInterruptedException;
import static com.aspose.psd.examples.Utils.Utils.getDateTime;
import com.aspose.psd.multithreading.InterruptMonitor;
import java.text.DateFormat;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
```

Let's break down the process of saving images using worker threads into simple steps:

## Step 1: Initialize SaveImageWorker

Create a class named `SaveImageWorker` and initialize the required variables:

```java
public class SaveImageWorker {
    // ... (Refer to provided code for variable declarations)
    
    public SaveImageWorker(String inputPath, String outputPath, ImageOptionsBase saveOptions, InterruptMonitor monitor) {
        // Constructor logic
    }
    
    // ... (Refer to provided code for additional methods)
}
```

## Step 2: Define ThreadProc Method

Implement the `ThreadProc` method to convert an image from one format to another while handling interruptions:

```java
public String ThreadProc() {
    Image image = Image.load(this.inputPath);

    InterruptMonitor.setThreadLocalInstance(this.monitor);

    try {
        image.save(this.outputPath, this.saveOptions);
    } catch (OperationInterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("The save thread #" + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " finishes at " + getDateTime().toString());
        System.out.println(e);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    } finally {
        InterruptMonitor.setThreadLocalInstance(null);
    }

    return "Hello Aspose";
}
```

## Step 3: Utilize SaveImageWorker

In your main application, create an instance of `SaveImageWorker` and utilize it to save images with worker threads:

```java
public class MainApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... (Initialize inputPath, outputPath, saveOptions, and monitor)
        
        SaveImageWorker saveImageWorker = new SaveImageWorker(inputPath, outputPath, saveOptions, monitor);
        String result = saveImageWorker.ThreadProc();
        
        // ... (Handle the result as needed)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to save images using worker threads with Aspose.PSD for Java. This approach ensures efficient image processing with the added benefit of handling interruptions seamlessly.
