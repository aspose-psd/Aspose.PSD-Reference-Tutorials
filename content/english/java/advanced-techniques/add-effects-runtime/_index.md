## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system. You can download the latest JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

3. Document Directory: Set up a directory for your documents, and remember the path. In the provided example, the directory is referred to as `Your Document Directory`.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to leverage the functionalities of Aspose.PSD for Java.

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.DrawingAndFormattingImages;

import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.BlendMode;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.layereffects.ColorOverlayEffect;
import com.aspose.psd.imageloadoptions.PsdLoadOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the PSD Image

Begin by loading the PSD image on which you want to apply effects. Make sure to set the appropriate file path.

```java
String sourceFileName = "Your Document Directory/ThreeRegularLayers.psd";
String exportPath = "Your Document Directory/ThreeRegularLayersChanged.psd";

PsdLoadOptions loadOptions = new PsdLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setLoadEffectsResource(true);

PsdImage im = (PsdImage)Image.load(sourceFileName, loadOptions);
```

## Step 2: Add Color Overlay Effect

In this step, we'll add a color overlay effect to a specific layer of the PSD image.

```java
ColorOverlayEffect effect = im.getLayers()[1].getBlendingOptions().addColorOverlay();
effect.setColor(Color.getGreen());
effect.setOpacity((byte)128);
effect.setBlendMode(BlendMode.Normal);
```

## Step 3: Save the Modified Image

Finally, save the modified image with the applied effects to a new file.

```java
im.save(exportPath);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully added effects at runtime using Aspose.PSD for Java.
