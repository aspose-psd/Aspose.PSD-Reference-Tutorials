## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on applying Gaussian and Wiener filters for color images using Aspose.PSD for Java. In this guide, we'll explore step by step how to enhance your color images with these powerful filters, providing you with the skills to optimize your visual content.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
- Aspose.PSD Library: Download and install the Aspose.PSD for Java library. You can find the necessary packages [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started, import the required packages into your Java project. Add the following lines to your code:

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.Conversion;

import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.RasterImage;

import com.aspose.psd.imagefilters.filteroptions.GaussWienerFilterOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.GifOptions;
```

Now, let's break down the example code into multiple steps for a clear understanding:

## Step 1: Load Image

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String sourceFile = dataDir + "sample.psd";
String destName = dataDir + "gauss_wiener_color_out.gif";

// Load the image from the source file
Image image = Image.load(sourceFile);
```

## Step 2: Cast Image to RasterImage

```java
// Cast the image into RasterImage
RasterImage rasterImage = (RasterImage)image;
if (rasterImage == null) {
    return;
}
```

## Step 3: Set Filter Options

```java
// Create an instance of GaussWienerFilterOptions class and set the radius size and smooth value.
GaussWienerFilterOptions options = new GaussWienerFilterOptions(5, 1.5);
options.setBrightness(1);
```

## Step 4: Apply Filters

```java
// Apply MedianFilterOptions filter to RasterImage object and Save the resultant image
rasterImage.filter(image.getBounds(), options);
image.save(destName, new GifOptions());
```

Repeat these steps, adjusting the parameters as needed for your specific use case.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to apply Gaussian and Wiener filters to color images using Aspose.PSD for Java. Experiment with different parameters to achieve the desired effects and enhance your images.

## FAQ's

### Q1: Can I use these filters for black and white images?

A1: Yes, you can apply Gaussian and Wiener filters to both color and black-and-white images.
