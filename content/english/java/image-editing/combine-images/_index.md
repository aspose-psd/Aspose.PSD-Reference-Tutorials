## Introduction

In the realm of Java programming, Aspose.PSD stands out as a powerful tool for manipulating and processing images. One of its noteworthy features is the ability to combine multiple images seamlessly. This tutorial will guide you through the process of merging two images into a single PSD file using Aspose.PSD for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.PSD Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.PSD library installed in your Java environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.PSD requires Java to run. Install the latest JDK on your machine.

3. Document Directory: Set up a directory where your images and resulting PSD file will be stored.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary packages for your Java project. Include the Aspose.PSD library in your project, as demonstrated below:

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.DrawingAndFormattingImages;

import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Graphics;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.FileCreateSource;
```

## Step 1: Create PSD Options

Begin by creating an instance of PsdOptions and setting its various properties:

```java
PsdOptions imageOptions = new PsdOptions();
```

## Step 2: Set FileCreateSource

Create an instance of FileCreateSource and assign it to the Source property:

```java
imageOptions.setSource(new FileCreateSource(dataDir + "Two_images_result_out.psd", false));
```

## Step 3: Create Image Instance

Instantiate an Image object with specified options and dimensions:

```java
Image image = Image.create(imageOptions, 600, 600);
```

## Step 4: Initialize Graphics

Create and initialize a Graphics instance, clear the image surface with white color, and draw the first image:

```java
Graphics graphics = new Graphics(image);
graphics.clear(Color.getWhite());
graphics.drawImage(Image.load(dataDir + "example1.psd"), 0, 0, 300, 600);
```

## Step 5: Draw the Second Image

Draw the second image on the created PSD canvas:

```java
graphics.drawImage(Image.load(dataDir + "example2.psd"), 300, 0, 300, 600);
```

## Step 6: Save the Resulting Image

Save the final combined image:

```java
image.save();
```

Congratulations! You have successfully combined two images into a single PSD file using Aspose.PSD for Java.
