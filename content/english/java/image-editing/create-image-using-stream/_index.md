## Introduction

In the realm of Java development, Aspose.PSD stands out as a robust library for image processing. One of its powerful features is the ability to create images using streams, offering flexibility and efficiency in handling image data. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating images using stream in Aspose.PSD for Java, providing a hands-on experience with step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.PSD Library: Download and set up the Aspose.PSD library for Java. You can find the necessary resources in the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose a Java-compatible IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, for a seamless development experience.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the required packages into your Java project. Include the Aspose.PSD library to leverage its functionalities in your code. Here's a basic example:

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.BmpOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.FileCreateSource;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.StreamSource;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.FileMode;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.FileStream;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.Stream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Specify Output File Name

```java
String desName = dataDir + "CreatingImageUsingStream_out.bmp";
```

Define the desired name for the output image file.

## Step 3: Configure BmpOptions

```java
BmpOptions imageOptions = new BmpOptions();
imageOptions.setBitsPerPixel(24);
```

Create an instance of `BmpOptions` and configure its properties, such as the bits per pixel.

## Step 4: Create FileCreateSource

```java
FileCreateSource stream = new FileCreateSource(dataDir + "sample_out.bmp");
imageOptions.setSource(stream);
```

Instantiate a `FileCreateSource` using your data directory, and set it as the source for `BmpOptions`.

## Step 5: Generate Image

```java
Image image = Image.create(imageOptions, 500, 500);
```

Create an instance of `Image` by invoking the `create` method, passing the configured `BmpOptions` and specifying the dimensions of the image.

## Step 6: Image Processing

```java
// Perform desired image processing operations
// ...

// Save the processed image
image.save(desName);
```

Perform any required image processing operations and save the resulting image using the `save` method.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to create images using stream in Aspose.PSD for Java. This tutorial covered essential steps, from importing packages to the final image processing and saving. Experiment with different settings and explore additional features to enhance your image creation capabilities.
