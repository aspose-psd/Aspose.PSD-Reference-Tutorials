## Introduction

In the realm of Java development, managing and manipulating image metadata is crucial for various applications. Aspose.PSD for Java stands out as a powerful tool for handling PSD files, and in this tutorial, we'll delve into creating XMP metadata using this robust library.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Have Java installed on your system, and a basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.PSD Library: Download and set up the Aspose.PSD library for Java. You can find the library and detailed documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/java/).
- Your Document Directory: Define the directory where your document files are stored.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to leverage Aspose.PSD functionalities:

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.DrawingAndFormattingImages;

import com.aspose.psd.Rectangle;

import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.MemoryStream;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.XmpHeaderPi;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.XmpMeta;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.XmpPacketWrapper;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.XmpTrailerPi;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.schemas.dublincore.DublinCorePackage;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.schemas.photoshop.ColorMode;
import com.aspose.psd.xmp.schemas.photoshop.PhotoshopPackage;
```

## Step 1: Specify Image Size

```java
// Specify the size of the image by defining a Rectangle
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 200);
```

## Step 2: Create a New Image

```java
// Create a brand new image for sample purposes
PsdImage image = new PsdImage(rect.getWidth(), rect.getHeight());
```

## Step 3: Create XMP Header

```java
// Create an instance of XMP-Header
XmpHeaderPi xmpHeader = new XmpHeaderPi();
xmpHeader.setGuid("Your Document Directory");
```

## Step 4: Create XMP Trailer

```java
// Create an instance of Xmp-TrailerPi 
XmpTrailerPi xmpTrailer = new XmpTrailerPi(true);
```

## Step 5: Create XMP Metadata

```java
// Create an instance of XMPmeta class to set different attributes
XmpMeta xmpMeta = new XmpMeta();
xmpMeta.addAttribute("Author", "Mr Smith");
xmpMeta.addAttribute("Description", "The fake metadata value");
```

## Step 6: Create XMP Packet Wrapper

```java
// Create an instance of XmpPacketWrapper that contains all metadata
XmpPacketWrapper xmpData = new XmpPacketWrapper(xmpHeader, xmpTrailer, xmpMeta);
```

## Step 7: Set Photoshop Attributes

```java
// Create an instance of Photoshop package and set Photoshop attributes
PhotoshopPackage photoshopPackage = new PhotoshopPackage();
photoshopPackage.setCity("London");
photoshopPackage.setCountry("England");
photoshopPackage.setColorMode(ColorMode.Rgb);
```

## Step 8: Add Photoshop Package to XMP Metadata

```java
// Add Photoshop package into XMP metadata
xmpData.addPackage(photoshopPackage);
```

## Step 9: Set DublinCore Attributes

```java
// Create an instance of DublinCore package and set DublinCore attributes
DublinCorePackage dublinCorePackage = new DublinCorePackage();
dublinCorePackage.setAuthor("Charles Bukowski");
dublinCorePackage.setTitle("Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live With the Beasts");
dublinCorePackage.addValue("dc:movie", "Barfly");
```

## Step 10: Add DublinCore Package to XMP Metadata

```java
// Add DublinCore Package into XMP metadata
xmpData.addPackage(dublinCorePackage);
```

## Step 11: Update XMP Metadata into Image

```java
// Update XMP metadata into the image
image.setXmpData(xmpData);
```

## Step 12: Save Image

```java
// Save the image on the disk or in a memory stream
image.save("Your Document Directory" + "create_XMP_Metadata.psd");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created XMP metadata for an image using Aspose.PSD for Java. This tutorial has equipped you with the essential steps to enhance and manage metadata in your Java applications seamlessly.
