## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance your Java application's image export capabilities in a multi-threaded environment? Aspose.PSD for Java is the perfect solution! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of exporting images using Aspose.PSD in a multi-threaded setup. Get ready to unlock the potential of your Java application.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- A Java development environment set up.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library downloaded and installed. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
## Import Packages
To get started, you need to import the necessary packages into your Java project. Add the following lines to your code:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.RasterImage;
import com.aspose.psd.Rectangle;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.StreamSource;
import com.aspose.psd.system.io.FileStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps.
## Step 1: Set up Document Directory
Begin by specifying the path to your document directory:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load PSD Image
Load the PSD image from the specified path using the following code:
```java
String imageDataPath = dataDir + "sample.psd";
FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(imageDataPath);
PsdOptions psdOptions = new PsdOptions();
psdOptions.setSource(new StreamSource(fileStream));
```
## Step 3: Process the Image
Perform processing on the loaded image. In this example, we create a RasterImage and save pixels:
```java
RasterImage image = (RasterImage)Image.create(psdOptions, 10, 10);
Color[] pixels = new Color[4];
for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    pixels[i] = Color.fromArgb(40, 30, 20, 10);
}
image.savePixels(new Rectangle(0, 0, 2, 2), pixels);
image.save();
```
## Step 4: Clean Up
Ensure to delete the output file after processing:
```java
File f = new File(imageDataPath);
if (f.exists()) {
    f.delete();
}
```
Now you've successfully exported images in a multi-threaded environment using Aspose.PSD for Java!
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored the seamless process of exporting images with Aspose.PSD for Java in a multi-threaded setup. Elevate your Java application's image processing capabilities with the power of Aspose.PSD.
