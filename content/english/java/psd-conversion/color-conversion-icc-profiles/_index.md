## Introduction
Welcome to a comprehensive guide on color conversion using ICC profiles in Aspose.PSD for Java. In this tutorial, we will explore the steps to perform color conversion, emphasizing the use of ICC profiles to achieve accurate and consistent results. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a beginner, this guide will walk you through the process with detailed explanations and examples.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.PSD for Java Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.PSD library installed. You can download it from the [releases](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/) page.
2. Java Development Environment: A working Java development environment is essential for executing the code. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
3. ICC Profiles: Obtain the necessary ICC profiles for color conversion. You can find suitable profiles, such as `eciRGB_v2.icc` and `ISOcoated_v2_FullGamut4.icc`, from reliable sources.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, import the required Aspose.PSD packages. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies included in your project setup.
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.jpeg.JpegCompressionColorMode;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.JpegOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.StreamSource;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
```
Now, let's break down the color conversion process into a step-by-step guide:
## Step 1: Create a New Image
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
PsdImage image = new PsdImage(500, 500);
```
## Step 2: Fill Image Data
```java
int count = image.getWidth() * image.getHeight();
int[] pixels = new int[count];
int r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, channel = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    // Fill pixels with color values.
    // ...
}
// Save the newly created pixels.
image.saveArgb32Pixels(image.getBounds(), pixels);
```
## Step 3: Save Image with Default ICC Profiles
```java
image.save(dataDir + "Default_profiles.jpg");
```
## Step 4: Update Color Profile
```java
File rgbFile = new File(dataDir + "eciRGB_v2.icc");
FileInputStream rgbInputStream = new FileInputStream(rgbFile);
StreamSource rgbprofile = new StreamSource(rgbInputStream);
File cmykFile = new File(dataDir + "ISOcoated_v2_FullGamut4.icc");
FileInputStream cmykInputStream = new FileInputStream(cmykFile);
StreamSource cmykprofile = new StreamSource(cmykInputStream);
image.setRgbColorProfile(rgbprofile);
image.setCmykColorProfile(cmykprofile);
```
## Step 5: Save Image with New YCCK Profiles
```java
JpegOptions options = new JpegOptions();
options.setColorType(JpegCompressionColorMode.Ycck);
image.save(dataDir + "Ycck_profiles.jpg", options);
```
Follow these steps carefully to perform color conversion using ICC profiles with Aspose.PSD for Java.
