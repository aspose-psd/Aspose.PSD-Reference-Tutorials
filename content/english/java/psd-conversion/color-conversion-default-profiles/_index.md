## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Installed Aspose.PSD for Java.
- Familiarity with image processing concepts.
- Java development environment set up.
## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. Ensure you have the Aspose.PSD library integrated. Here's a sample import statement:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.jpeg.JpegCompressionColorMode;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.JpegOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.StreamSource;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
```
## Step 1: Set up the Document Directory
Begin by defining the path to your document directory:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create a PSD Image
Generate a new PSD image with a specified width and height:
```java
PsdImage image = new PsdImage(500, 500);
```
## Step 3: Fill Image Data
Populate the image with pixel data, incorporating color variations:
```java
// ... [Code for filling image data]
```
## Step 4: Save Newly Created Pixels
Save the manipulated pixels to create a new image:
```java
image.saveArgb32Pixels(image.getBounds(), pixels);
```
## Step 5: Save the Newly Created Image
Save the image with default color profiles:
```java
image.save(dataDir + "Default.jpg");
```
## Step 6: Update Color Profile
Specify and update the color profiles for RGB and CMYK:
```java
// ... [Code for updating color profiles]
```
## Step 7: Save Resultant Image with New Profiles
Save the image with modified color profiles:
```java
JpegOptions options = new JpegOptions();
options.setColorType(JpegCompressionColorMode.Cmyk);
image.save(dataDir + "Cmyk_Default_profiles.jpg", options);
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the process of color conversion using default profiles in Aspose.PSD for Java. This powerful feature empowers developers to manipulate image color profiles with ease, providing a versatile solution for various applications.
