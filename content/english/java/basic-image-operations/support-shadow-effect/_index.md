## Introduction

Enhancing images with shadow effects is a common practice in graphic design, adding depth and realism. Aspose.PSD for Java provides robust support for shadow effects, allowing developers to effortlessly integrate these effects into their Java applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to support shadow effects using Aspose.PSD, step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.PSD for Java installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

## Import Packages

Ensure that you've imported the necessary packages to leverage Aspose.PSD functionalities in your Java application. Use the following code snippet as a guide:

```java
package com.aspose.psd.examples.DrawingAndFormattingImages;

import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;


import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.layereffects.DropShadowEffect;
import com.aspose.psd.imageloadoptions.PsdLoadOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the PSD Image

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String sourceFileName = dataDir + "Shadow.psd";
String psdPathAfterChange = dataDir + "ShadowChanged.psd";

PsdLoadOptions loadOptions = new PsdLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setLoadEffectsResource(true);

PsdImage im = (PsdImage)Image.load(sourceFileName, loadOptions);
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Shadow Effect

```java
DropShadowEffect shadowEffect = (DropShadowEffect)(im.getLayers()[1].getBlendingOptions().getEffects()[0]);
```

## Step 3: Verify Default Settings

```java
Assert.areEqual(Color.getBlack(), shadowEffect.getColor());
Assert.areEqual(255, shadowEffect.getOpacity());
Assert.areEqual(3, shadowEffect.getDistance());
Assert.areEqual(7, shadowEffect.getSize());
Assert.areEqual(true, shadowEffect.getUseGlobalLight());
Assert.areEqual(90, shadowEffect.getAngle());
Assert.areEqual(0, shadowEffect.getSpread());
Assert.areEqual(0, shadowEffect.getNoise());
```

## Step 4: Customize Shadow Effect

```java
shadowEffect.setColor(Color.getGreen());
shadowEffect.setOpacity((byte)128);
shadowEffect.setDistance(11);
shadowEffect.setUseGlobalLight(false);
shadowEffect.setSize(9);
shadowEffect.setAngle(45);
shadowEffect.setSpread(3);
shadowEffect.setNoise(50);
```

## Step 5: Save the Modified Image

```java
im.save(psdPathAfterChange);
```

## Conclusion

With these simple steps, you can effortlessly support shadow effects in Aspose.PSD for Java, enhancing the visual appeal of your images.
