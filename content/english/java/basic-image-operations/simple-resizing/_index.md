## Introduction

In today's tutorial, we'll delve into the process of simple image resizing using Aspose.PSD for Java, a powerful library that facilitates efficient image manipulation. If you're a Java developer seeking a seamless way to resize images programmatically, you're in the right place.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on our journey of image resizing with Aspose.PSD, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

2. Aspose.PSD for Java: Download and install the Aspose.PSD library. You can find the necessary packages on the [Aspose.PSD for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

Now that we have our prerequisites sorted, let's dive into the core of our tutorial.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary packages to kick off your image resizing process. Include the following lines of code at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.JpegOptions;
```

These packages will enable you to work with Aspose.PSD and handle JPEG image options.

## Step 1: Set Your Document Directory

Begin by defining the directory where your PSD file is located. Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your PSD file.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Specify Source and Destination Paths

Now, define the paths for your source PSD file and the destination where the resized image will be saved.

```java
String sourceFile = dataDir + "sample.psd";
String destName = dataDir + "SimpleResizing_out.jpg";
```

## Step 3: Load the Image

Load the existing image into an instance of the RasterImage class using the following code:

```java
Image image = Image.load(sourceFile);
```

## Step 4: Resize the Image

Resize the image to your desired dimensions. In this example, we're resizing it to 300x300 pixels.

```java
image.resize(300, 300);
```

## Step 5: Save the Resized Image

Save the resized image using the specified destination path and JpegOptions.

```java
image.save(destName, new JpegOptions());
```

Congratulations! You've successfully resized an image using Aspose.PSD for Java. Feel free to experiment with different dimensions to suit your requirements.
