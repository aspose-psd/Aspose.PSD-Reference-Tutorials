## Introduction

In the dynamic realm of .NET development, Aspose.PSD stands out as a powerful tool for handling image manipulation. This tutorial focuses on a fundamental task: constructing rectangles using Aspose.PSD for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, ensuring you grasp each concept thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Environment Setup: Have a working .NET development environment with Aspose.PSD integrated. If you haven't already, refer to the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/) for installation instructions.

- Download Aspose.PSD: Make sure you've downloaded the Aspose.PSD library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

- Get a License: If you're using Aspose.PSD in a production environment, ensure you have a valid license. You can obtain one [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or use a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for testing.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces provide access to the Aspose.PSD functionality required for drawing rectangles.

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.Brushes;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Document Directory

Set the path to your document directory where the output image will be saved.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Drawing Rectangles

Now, let's delve into the process of drawing rectangles using Aspose.PSD.

### Step 2.1: Create an Instance of BmpOptions

```csharp
string outpath = dataDir + "Rectangle.bmp";
BmpOptions saveOptions = new BmpOptions();
saveOptions.BitsPerPixel = 32;
```

### Step 2.2: Create an Instance of Image

```csharp
using (Image image = new PsdImage(100, 100))
{
    // Step 2.3: Initialize Graphics Class and Clear Graphics Surface
    Graphics graphic = new Graphics(image);
    graphic.Clear(Color.Yellow);

    // Step 2.4: Draw Rectangles
    graphic.DrawRectangle(new Pen(Color.Red), new Rectangle(30, 10, 40, 80));
    graphic.DrawRectangle(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.Blue)), new Rectangle(10, 30, 80, 40));

    // Step 2.5: Export Image to BMP File Format
    image.Save(outpath, saveOptions);
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully constructed rectangles using Aspose.PSD for .NET. This tutorial equipped you with the knowledge to integrate image manipulation seamlessly into your .NET applications.
