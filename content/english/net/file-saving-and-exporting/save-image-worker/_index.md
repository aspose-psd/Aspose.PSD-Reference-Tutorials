## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.PSD provides a powerful toolkit for working with images. One key aspect is the `SaveImageWorker` class, which plays a crucial role in converting images from one format to another. This tutorial will guide you through the process of working with the `SaveImageWorker` in Aspose.PSD for .NET, breaking down each step for clarity and ease of implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
- Aspose.PSD for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.CoreExceptions;
using Aspose.PSD.Multithreading;
using System;
using System.Threading;
```

## Step 1: Initialize SaveImageWorker

Create an instance of the `SaveImageWorker` class, providing the input and output paths, save options, and an interrupt monitor if needed.

```csharp
SaveImageWorker saveImageWorker = new SaveImageWorker(inputPath, outputPath, saveOptions, monitor);
```

## Step 2: Load Input Image

Load the input image using the `Image.Load` method.

```csharp
using (Image image = Image.Load(saveImageWorker.InputPath))
{
    // Your code for image processing goes here
}
```

## Step 3: Set Interrupt Monitor

Set the thread-local instance of the interrupt monitor to handle interruptions during the save operation.

```csharp
InterruptMonitor.ThreadLocalInstance = saveImageWorker.Monitor;
```

## Step 4: Save Image

Attempt to save the image using the specified output path and save options. Handle interruptions gracefully.

```csharp
try
{
    image.Save(saveImageWorker.OutputPath, saveImageWorker.SaveOptions);
}
catch (OperationInterruptedException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The save thread #{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId} finishes at {DateTime.Now}");
    Console.WriteLine(e);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e);
}
finally
{
    InterruptMonitor.ThreadLocalInstance = null;
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, mastering the `SaveImageWorker` in Aspose.PSD for .NET allows seamless image format conversion with robust interruption handling. This step-by-step guide has equipped you with the knowledge to integrate this functionality into your .NET applications.
