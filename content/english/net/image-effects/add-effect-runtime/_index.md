## Introduction

Enhancing the visual appeal of images is a common requirement in graphic design and image processing applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to add effects at runtime using Aspose.PSD for .NET. Aspose.PSD is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Adobe Photoshop files seamlessly. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the step-by-step guide, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET framework.
- Aspose.PSD for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

## Import Namespaces

To get started, ensure that you include the necessary namespaces in your C# project. These namespaces are vital for utilizing the functionality provided by Aspose.PSD.

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Core.Blending;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageLoadOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your PSD files are located.

## Step 2: Load the PSD Image with Effects Resource

```csharp
string sourceFileName = dataDir + "ThreeRegularLayers.psd";
string exportPath = dataDir + "ThreeRegularLayersChanged.psd";

var loadOptions = new PsdLoadOptions()
{
    LoadEffectsResource = true
};

using (var im = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFileName, loadOptions))
```

This step loads the PSD image, enabling the loading of effects resources.

## Step 3: Add Color Overlay Layer Effect

```csharp
var effect = im.Layers[1].BlendingOptions.AddColorOverlay();
effect.Color = Color.Green;
effect.Opacity = 128;
effect.BlendMode = BlendMode.Normal;
```

Here, we add a color overlay effect to the second layer of the PSD image. You can customize the color, opacity, and blend mode according to your preferences.

## Step 4: Save the Modified Image

```csharp
im.Save(exportPath);
```

Finally, save the image with the applied effect to the specified export path.

## Conclusion

Adding effects at runtime in Aspose.PSD for .NET is a straightforward process. With just a few lines of code, you can enhance the visual appeal of your images dynamically. Experiment with different effects and parameters to achieve the desired results.
