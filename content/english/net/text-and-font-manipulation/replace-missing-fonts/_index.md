## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Aspose.PSD for .NET, where font replacement becomes a breeze! In this tutorial, we'll delve into the intricate process of setting up and replacing missing fonts in your PSD files using Aspose.PSD. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, our step-by-step guide will empower you to handle font-related challenges with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.PSD for .NET: Ensure you have the library installed. If not, download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- Document Directory: Have a dedicated directory for your PSD documents.
- Output Directory: Create a separate folder where the modified files will be saved.
## Import Namespaces
Let's kick things off by importing the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces are vital for accessing the functionalities offered by Aspose.PSD.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageLoadOptions;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```
## Step 1: Loading the PSD File
Begin by setting up the paths to your document and output directories. This is the foundation for our font replacement journey.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
string sourceFileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "sample_konstanting.psd");
```
## Step 2: Setting for Replacing Missing Fonts
Now, let's focus on the core functionality â€“ replacing missing fonts in your PSD file. We'll provide different examples for various output formats, each with its unique replacement font.
```csharp
string[] outputs = new string[]
{
    "replacedfont0.tiff",
    "replacedfont1.png",
    "replacedfont2.jpg"
};
using (PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFileName, new PsdLoadOptions()))
{
    // Example 1: Tiff Format with Arial Font Replacement
    image.Save(Path.Combine(outputFolder, outputs[0]), new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.TiffJpegRgb) { DefaultReplacementFont = "Arial" });
    // Example 2: PNG Format with Verdana Font Replacement
    image.Save(Path.Combine(outputFolder, outputs[1]), new PngOptions { DefaultReplacementFont = "Verdana" });
    // Example 3: JPG Format with Times New Roman Font Replacement
    image.Save(Path.Combine(outputFolder, outputs[2]), new JpegOptions { DefaultReplacementFont = "Times New Roman" });
}
```
