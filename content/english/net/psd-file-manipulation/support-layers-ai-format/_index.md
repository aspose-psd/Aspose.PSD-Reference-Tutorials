Welcome to our step-by-step guide on leveraging Aspose.PSD for .NET to handle supporting layers in AI format files. Aspose.PSD simplifies complex tasks, making it easier for developers to work with AI files in their .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll cover the prerequisites, importing namespaces, and break down each example into multiple steps to ensure a seamless learning experience.
## Introduction
### What is Aspose.PSD?
Aspose.PSD for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to manipulate and process Adobe Photoshop files, including AI (Adobe Illustrator) format. In this tutorial, we'll focus on supporting layers in AI files, showcasing how to extract valuable information from each layer.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
1. Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose.PSD website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a working .NET development environment, including Visual Studio.
3. Sample AI File: Download the sample AI file, "form_8_2l3_7.ai," from [this link](Your-Download-Link).
## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:
```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Ai;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Png;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Load AI File
Load the AI file into your application using the following code:
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "form_8_2l3_7.ai");
using (AiImage image = (AiImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for further processing goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Access Layer Information
Now, let's extract information from the first layer:
```csharp
AiLayerSection layer0 = image.Layers[0];
// Your assertions and validations for Layer 0 go here
```
## Step 3: Validate Layer Properties
Check various properties of the first layer, such as name, visibility, and color:
```csharp
AssertIsTrue(layer0 != null, "Layer 0 should not be null.");
AssertIsTrue(layer0.Name == "Layer 4", "Layer 0 name should be `Layer 4`");
// Add more assertions for other properties
```
## Step 4: Accessing Raster Images
If the layer contains raster images, you can access them as follows:
```csharp
AiRasterImageSection rasterImage = layer1.RasterImages[0];
// Your assertions and validations for raster image go here
```
## Step 5: Save Processed Images
Finally, save the processed images in PSD and PNG formats:
```csharp
image.Save(outputFilePath + ".psd", new PsdOptions());
image.Save(outputFilePath + ".png", new PngOptions() { ColorType = PngColorType.TruecolorWithAlpha });
```
Repeat these steps for other layers as needed.
