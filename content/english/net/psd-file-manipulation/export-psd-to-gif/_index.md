## Introduction
Aspose.PSD for .NET is a powerful library that facilitates working with PSD images in .NET applications. Among its versatile features is the ability to export PSD images to GIF format. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, ensuring you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET projects.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Download and install the library from [Aspose.PSD for .NET Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your PSD documents.
- Output Directory: Prepare a directory where the exported GIF images will be saved.
## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. This step ensures that you have access to the Aspose.PSD functionalities.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageLoadOptions;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```
## Step 1: Load PSD Image
```csharp
string baseDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFile = Path.Combine(baseDir, "4GIF_animated.psd");
using (var psdImage = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFile, new PsdLoadOptions() { LoadEffectsResource = true }))
{
    // Your code for further processing goes here
}
```
This code snippet loads a PSD image, ensuring effects resources are loaded as well.
## Step 2: Export to GIF Image
```csharp
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
string outputGif = Path.Combine(outputDir, "out_4_animated.psd.gif");
psdImage.Timeline.Save(outputGif, new GifOptions());
```
Export the loaded PSD image to a GIF format using the `Save` method with GifOptions.
## Step 3: Clean Up
```csharp
File.Delete(outputGif);
```
Perform any necessary cleanup, such as deleting temporary files.
