## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on implementing Gamma Adjustment in Aspose.PSD for .NET! Gamma adjustment is a crucial image processing technique that allows you to fine-tune the brightness and contrast of an image. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process using the powerful Aspose.PSD library for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.PSD library for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

- .NET Framework: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of .NET development and have the .NET Framework installed.

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE for .NET development, such as Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.PSD:

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new .NET project in your chosen IDE. Make sure to add references to the Aspose.PSD library.

## Step 2: Define the Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 3: Load the Image

```csharp
string sourceFile = dataDir + @"sample.psd";
using (var image = Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
    // Additional steps will be performed inside this using block.
}
```

## Step 4: Cast to RasterImage and Cache Data

```csharp
RasterImage rasterImage = (RasterImage)image;
if (!rasterImage.IsCached)
{
    rasterImage.CacheData();
}
```

## Step 5: Adjust Gamma

```csharp
rasterImage.AdjustGamma(2.2f, 2.2f, 2.2f);
```

## Step 6: Create TiffOptions and Save

```csharp
string destName = dataDir + @"AdjustGamma_out.tiff";
TiffOptions tiffOptions = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.Default);
tiffOptions.BitsPerSample = new ushort[] { 8, 8, 8 };
tiffOptions.Photometric = TiffPhotometrics.Rgb;
rasterImage.Save(destName, tiffOptions);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented Gamma Adjustment using Aspose.PSD for .NET. This powerful library provides robust capabilities for image processing, making it a valuable tool for .NET developers.
