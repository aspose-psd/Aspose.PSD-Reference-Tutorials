## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.PSD stands out as a powerful tool for manipulating and processing Photoshop files. Among its rich features, supporting ObAr and UnFl signatures is crucial for advanced image editing. This tutorial will guide you through the process, breaking down each step to ensure a seamless implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of .NET programming.
- Aspose.PSD for .NET installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- A sample PSD file for testing. You can use "LayeredSmartObjects8bit2.psd" from your document directory.

## Import Namespaces

Ensure you import the necessary namespaces for your .NET project to leverage Aspose.PSD functionality:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.LayerResources;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.LayerResources.TypeToolInfoStructures;
```

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Load the PSD Image

```csharp
string baseFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string sourceFilePath = baseFolder + "LayeredSmartObjects8bit2.psd";

using (PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your code for image processing goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Support ObAr and UnFl Signatures

```csharp
//ExStart:SupportOfObArAndUnFlSignatures
void AssertAreEqual(object actual, object expected)
{
    // Your assertion logic goes here
}

UnitArrayStructure verticalStructure = null;

foreach (Layer imageLayer in image.Layers)
{
    foreach (var imageResource in imageLayer.Resources)
    {
        var resource = imageResource as PlLdResource;

        if (resource != null && resource.IsCustom)
        {
            foreach (OSTypeStructure structure in resource.Items)
            {
                if (structure.KeyName.ClassName == "customEnvelopeWarp")
                {
                    AssertAreEqual(typeof(DescriptorStructure), structure.GetType());
                    var custom = (DescriptorStructure)structure;
                    AssertAreEqual(custom.Structures.Length, 1);
                    var mesh = custom.Structures[0];
                    AssertAreEqual(typeof(ObjectArrayStructure), mesh.GetType());
                    var meshObjectArray = (ObjectArrayStructure)mesh;
                    AssertAreEqual(meshObjectArray.Structures.Length, 2);
                    var vertical = meshObjectArray.Structures[1];
                    AssertAreEqual(typeof(UnitArrayStructure), vertical.GetType());
                    verticalStructure = (UnitArrayStructure)vertical;
                    AssertAreEqual(verticalStructure.UnitType, UnitTypes.Pixels);
                    AssertAreEqual(verticalStructure.ValueCount, 16);

                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

AssertAreEqual(true, verticalStructure != null);
//ExEnd:SupportOfObArAndUnFlSignatures

Console.WriteLine("SupportOfObArAndUnFlSignatures executed successfully");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented support for ObAr and UnFl signatures in Aspose.PSD for .NET. This feature opens up new possibilities for advanced image editing and manipulation in your .NET applications.
