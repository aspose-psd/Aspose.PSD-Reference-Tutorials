## Introduction

Aspose.PSD for .NET is a comprehensive imaging library that allows developers to work with various image formats in their .NET applications. One of its standout features is the capability to manipulate images with ease. In this tutorial, we'll focus on expanding and cropping images, providing you with a hands-on guide to achieve these tasks using Aspose.PSD.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.PSD for .NET library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.PSD for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/).

- Sample Image: Prepare a sample image file (e.g., "example1.psd") that you'll use for the tutorial.

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionalities provided by Aspose.PSD for .NET. Add the following namespaces to your code:

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

Ensure that you have a project set up with Aspose.PSD for .NET integrated. If not, follow the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/) for guidance.

## Step 2: Load the Image

Load the sample image using the following code:

```csharp
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_DrawingAndFormattingImages();
string sourceFile = dataDir + @"example1.psd";

// Load the image
using (RasterImage rasterImage = (RasterImage)Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
    // Additional code for image processing will go here
}
```

## Step 3: Cache Image Data

Cache the image data to optimize performance:

```csharp
rasterImage.CacheData();
```

## Step 4: Define Destination Rectangle

Create an instance of the Rectangle class and define the X, Y, Width, and Height of the rectangle. This will be the area to which the image will be expanded or cropped.

```csharp
Rectangle destRect = new Rectangle { X = -200, Y = -200, Width = 300, Height = 300 };
```

## Step 5: Save the Output Image

Save the output image with the specified options and destination rectangle:

```csharp
string destName = dataDir + @"jpeg_out.jpg";
rasterImage.Save(destName, new JpegOptions(), destRect);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to expand and crop images using Aspose.PSD for .NET. This powerful library opens up a world of possibilities for image manipulation within your .NET applications.
