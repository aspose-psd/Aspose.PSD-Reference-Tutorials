# Rendering Gradient Overlay Effect in Aspose.PSD for .NET

In the realm of graphic design and image processing with .NET, Aspose.PSD stands out as a powerful library, offering a myriad of features to enhance your creativity. One such remarkable capability is the rendering of the Gradient Overlay Effect, adding depth and vibrancy to your images. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process using Aspose.PSD for .NET.

## Introduction

Unlock the potential of your images by mastering the Gradient Overlay Effect in Aspose.PSD for .NET. This tutorial will empower you to elevate your graphic design skills and create visually stunning images with ease. Follow the steps below to seamlessly integrate this effect into your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PSD Library: Download and install the Aspose.PSD library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory for your documents where you can store your source and output files.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces are crucial for leveraging the features of Aspose.PSD.

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageLoadOptions;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Set Your Document Directory

```csharp
string SourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
string OutputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" and "Your Output Directory" with the paths to your source PSD file and the desired output directory, respectively.

## Step 2: Load the PSD Image with Gradient Overlay

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(SourceDir, "gradientOverlayEffect.psd");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, "output");
string outputPng = outputFilePath + ".png";
string outputPsd = outputFilePath + ".psd";
```

Specify the file paths for your source PSD file and the output files in PNG and PSD formats.

## Step 3: Rendering the Gradient Overlay Effect

```csharp
using (var psdImage = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath, new PsdLoadOptions() { LoadEffectsResource = true }))
{
    psdImage.Save(outputPng, new PngOptions());
    psdImage.Save(outputPsd);
}
```

Utilize the Aspose.PSD library to load the PSD image, enabling the loading of effects resources. Save the rendered image in both PNG and PSD formats.

## Conclusion
