# Adding Signature to Images with Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.PSD stands out as a powerful tool for manipulating and enhancing images. If you've ever wondered how to add a signature to images seamlessly using Aspose.PSD for .NET, you're in the right place. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, ensuring you master the art of incorporating signatures into your images effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.PSD for .NET library, which you can download [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

## Import Namespaces

To start, include the necessary namespaces in your project to access the Aspose.PSD functionality. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

Now, let's break down the process into simple steps.

## Step 1: Set Your Document Directory

Begin by defining the path to your document directory. This will be the location where your images are stored.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the Primary Image

Create an instance of the `Image` class and load the primary image that you want to add the signature to.

```csharp
using (Image canvas = Image.Load(dataDir + "layers.psd"))
{
    // Your code for image manipulation goes here
}
```

## Step 3: Load the Signature Image

Now, create another instance of the `Image` class and load the secondary image containing the signature graphics.

```csharp
using (Image signature = Image.Load(dataDir + "sample.psd"))
{
    // Your code for signature image manipulation goes here
}
```

## Step 4: Initialize Graphics and Draw Signature

Create an instance of the `Graphics` class and initialize it using the object of the primary image. Use the `DrawImage` method to add the signature to the desired location on the primary image.

```csharp
Graphics graphics = new Graphics(canvas);
graphics.DrawImage(signature, new Point(canvas.Height - signature.Height, canvas.Width - signature.Width));
```

## Step 5: Save the Result

Finally, save the modified image to your desired output format, such as PNG.

```csharp
canvas.Save(dataDir + "AddSignatureToImage_out.png", new PngOptions());
```

Now you've successfully added a signature to an image using Aspose.PSD for .NET!
