# Resizing Images Proportionally in Aspose.PSD for .NET

In the realm of image manipulation, Aspose.PSD for .NET stands out as a powerful toolkit, providing developers with the capability to resize images proportionally with ease. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of resizing images using Aspose.PSD for .NET, ensuring that your images maintain their proportions flawlessly.

## Introduction

Resizing images proportionally is a common task in many applications, and Aspose.PSD for .NET simplifies this process for developers. Whether you're working on a web application, desktop software, or mobile app, understanding how to resize images while preserving their aspect ratio is crucial for maintaining visual appeal and consistency.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the resizing magic with Aspose.PSD for .NET, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.PSD for .NET library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.PSD for .NET releases](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/) page.

2. Document Directory: Create a directory to store your documents, and replace "Your Document Directory" in the provided code with the actual path to this directory.

Now that you have the prerequisites set up, let's jump into the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

Import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods.

## Step 1: Load the Image

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

string sourceFile = dataDir + @"sample.psd";

// Load an existing image into an instance of RasterImage class
using (Image image = Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
	if (!image.IsCached)
	{
		image.CacheData();
	}
	// Rest of the steps go here
}
```

Load the source image using the `Image.Load` method.

## Step 2: Specify Width and Height

```csharp
// Specifying width and height
int newWidth = image.Width / 2;
image.ResizeWidthProportionally(newWidth);

int newHeight = image.Height / 2;
image.ResizeHeightProportionally(newHeight);
```

Determine the new width and height for the resized image. In this example, the width and height are halved, but you can adjust these values based on your requirements.

## Step 3: Save the Resized Image

```csharp
string destName = dataDir + @"SimpleResizeImageProportionally_out.png";

image.Save(destName, new PngOptions());
```

Save the resized image using the `Save` method with specified options. In this case, we're saving it as a PNG file.
