# Adding Stroke Effects to Layers in Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on adding stroke effects to layers in Aspose.PSD for .NET. Enhancing the visual appeal of your images is a breeze with the stroke effect, and Aspose.PSD makes it seamless for .NET developers. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process, providing clear steps and examples to help you master this powerful feature.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.PSD library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

- Document Directory: Prepare a directory containing the PSD document you want to apply stroke effects to.

- Output Directory: Have a separate directory for storing the output images with stroke effects.

- Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio or any other preferred .NET development environment set up.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces to leverage Aspose.PSD functionality:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.FillSettings;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.LayerEffects;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageLoadOptions;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the PSD Document

```csharp
string srcFile = Path.Combine(SourceDir, "AddStrokeEffect.psd");
string outputFilePng = Path.Combine(OutputDir, "AddStrokeEffect.png");

using (var psdImage = (PsdImage)Image.Load(srcFile, new PsdLoadOptions() { LoadEffectsResource = true }))
{
    // Your code for loading the PSD document goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Add Color Stroke Effect

```csharp
// Adds Color fill, at position Inside
strokeEffect = psdImage.Layers[1].BlendingOptions.AddStroke(FillType.Color);
strokeEffect.Size = 7;
strokeEffect.Position = StrokePosition.Inside;
colorFillSettings = strokeEffect.FillSettings as IColorFillSettings;
colorFillSettings.Color = Color.Green;
```

## Step 3: Outside Position

```csharp
// Adds Color fill, at position Outside
strokeEffect = psdImage.Layers[2].BlendingOptions.AddStroke(FillType.Color);
strokeEffect.Size = 7;
strokeEffect.Position = StrokePosition.Outside;
colorFillSettings = strokeEffect.FillSettings as IColorFillSettings;
colorFillSettings.Color = Color.Green;
```

## Step 4: Center Position

```csharp
// Adds Color fill, at position Center
strokeEffect = psdImage.Layers[3].BlendingOptions.AddStroke(FillType.Color);
strokeEffect.Size = 7;
strokeEffect.Position = StrokePosition.Center;
colorFillSettings = strokeEffect.FillSettings as IColorFillSettings;
colorFillSettings.Color = Color.Green;
```

Repeat similar steps for Gradient and Pattern fills, adjusting settings accordingly.
