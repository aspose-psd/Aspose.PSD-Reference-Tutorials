Welcome to this comprehensive guide on applying Color Balance Adjustment in Aspose.PSD for .NET! Aspose.PSD is a powerful .NET library that allows developers to work with PSD files efficiently. In this tutorial, we will focus on the Color Balance Adjustment feature, enabling you to enhance the color balance of your PSD images with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose.PSD website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- Development Environment: Ensure that you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.PSD features. Add the following lines to your code:

```csharp

```

Now, let's break down the Color Balance Adjustment process into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the PSD File

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var filePath = dataDir + "ColorBalance.psd";
var outputPath = dataDir + "ColorBalance_out.psd";

using (var im = (FileFormats.Psd.PsdImage)Image.Load(filePath))
{
    // Code for the Color Balance Adjustment will be added in the following steps.
}
```

## Step 2: Access and Adjust Color Balance

```csharp
foreach (var layer in im.Layers)
{
    var cbLayer = layer as ColorBalanceAdjustmentLayer;
    if (cbLayer != null)
    {
        cbLayer.ShadowsCyanRedBalance = 30;
        cbLayer.ShadowsMagentaGreenBalance = -15;
        cbLayer.ShadowsYellowBlueBalance = 40;
        cbLayer.MidtonesCyanRedBalance = -90;
        cbLayer.MidtonesMagentaGreenBalance = -25;
        cbLayer.MidtonesYellowBlueBalance = 20;
        cbLayer.HighlightsCyanRedBalance = -30;
        cbLayer.HighlightsMagentaGreenBalance = 67;
        cbLayer.HighlightsYellowBlueBalance = -95;
        cbLayer.PreserveLuminosity = true;
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Save the Adjusted Image

```csharp
im.Save(outputPath);
```

Now, you've successfully applied Color Balance Adjustment to your PSD file using Aspose.PSD for .NET!
