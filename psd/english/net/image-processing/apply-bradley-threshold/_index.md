## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on applying Bradley Threshold in Aspose.PSD for .NET. Aspose.PSD for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to work with Photoshop files in your .NET applications. Bradley Thresholding is a technique used for image binarization, helping to separate objects from the background effectively.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of applying Bradley Threshold using Aspose.PSD for .NET. Before we dive into the steps, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites in place.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose.PSD for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- Document Directory: Create a directory to store your source PSD file and the resulting binarized image.

Now that you have the prerequisites ready, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, make sure to import the required namespaces to access Aspose.PSD functionality:

```csharp
// Import Aspose.PSD namespaces
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the Noisy Image

Define the path to your source PSD file and the destination for the binarized output:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

string sourceFile = dataDir + @"sample.psd";
string destName = dataDir + @"binarized_out.png";
```

## Step 2: Binarize the Image using Bradley Threshold

Load the PSD image, specify the threshold value, apply the Bradley Threshold, and save the output as a PNG image:

```csharp
// Load an image
using (PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
    // Define threshold value
    double threshold = 0.15;

    // Call BinarizeBradley method and pass the threshold value as a parameter
    image.BinarizeBradley(threshold);

    // Save the output image
    image.Save(destName, new PngOptions());
}
```
