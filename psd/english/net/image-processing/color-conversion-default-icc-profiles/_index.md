# Color Conversion using Default and ICC Profiles in Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction

Color conversion is a fundamental aspect of image manipulation, influencing how colors are represented in digital images. Aspose.PSD for .NET simplifies this process by providing comprehensive tools to handle color profiles seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- Installed Aspose.PSD for .NET. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, include the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Jpeg;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.PSD.Sources;
using System.IO;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Create a New Image

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_ModifyingAndConvertingImages();

// Create a new Image.
using (PsdImage image = new PsdImage(500, 500))
{
    // Fill image data.
    // ... (Code to fill image data)
    // Save the newly created pixels.
    image.SaveArgb32Pixels(image.Bounds, pixels);

    // Save the newly created image.
    image.Save(dataDir + "Default.jpg", new JpegOptions());
}
```

This step involves initializing a new PsdImage with a specified width and height. The image data is then filled, and the image is saved in the JPEG format.

## Step 2: Update Color Profile

```csharp
// Update color profile.
StreamSource rgbprofile = new StreamSource(File.OpenRead(dataDir + "eciRGB_v2.icc"));
StreamSource cmykprofile = new StreamSource(File.OpenRead(dataDir + "ISOcoated_v2_FullGamut4.icc"));
image.RgbColorProfile = rgbprofile;
image.CmykColorProfile = cmykprofile;
```

Here, we update the color profile of the image by assigning RGB and CMYK profiles to the respective properties.

## Step 3: Save Resultant Image

```csharp
// Save the resultant image with new YCCK profiles. You will notice differences in color values if compare the images.
JpegOptions options = new JpegOptions();
options.ColorType = JpegCompressionColorMode.Cmyk;
image.Save(dataDir + "Cmyk_Default_profiles.jpg", options);
```

Finally, we save the image with the updated color profiles, showcasing the differences in color values.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the process of color conversion using default and ICC profiles in Aspose.PSD for .NET. Understanding and implementing color conversion is crucial for achieving accurate and visually appealing images in your .NET applications.
