# Master Animated PSD Handling in Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on handling animated data sections in Aspose.PSD for .NET! If you're looking to enhance your PSD image manipulation skills, particularly when dealing with animated data, you've come to the right place. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process step by step, ensuring you grasp each concept thoroughly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.PSD for .NET installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- A code editor such as Visual Studio for seamless implementation.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, ensure you import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.PSD:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.LayerResources;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.LayerResources.TypeToolInfoStructures;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Resources;
```
Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for a better understanding.
## Step 1: Define Directories
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string baseDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```
Ensure you replace "Your Document Directory" and "Your Output Directory" with the actual paths.
## Step 2: Load and Modify Animated PSD
```csharp
string sourceFile = Path.Combine(baseDir, "3_animated.psd");
string outputPsd = Path.Combine(outputDir, "output_3_animated.psd");
using (PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
    // Your code for manipulating animated data goes here...
    // See the next steps for detailed instructions.
    
    image.Save(outputPsd);
}
```
## Step 3: Find and Modify Animated Data
```csharp
foreach (var imageResource in image.ImageResources)
{
    if (imageResource is AnimatedDataSectionResource)
    {
        var animatedData = (AnimatedDataSectionStructure)(imageResource as AnimatedDataSectionResource).AnimatedDataSection;
        var framesList = FindStructure<ListStructure>(animatedData.Items, "FrIn");
        var frame1 = (DescriptorStructure)framesList.Types[1];
        // Your code for updating the frame delay goes here...
        // See the next steps for detailed instructions.
        break;
    }
}
```
## Step 4: Add or Replace Frame Delay
```csharp
var frameDelay = new IntegerStructure(new ClassID("FrDl"));
frameDelay.Value = 100; // set time in centi-seconds.
frame1.Structures = AddOrReplaceStructure(frame1.Structures, frameDelay);
```
Ensure you customize the delay time according to your requirements.
## Step 5: Save and Clean Up
```csharp
image.Save(outputPsd);
```
This step ensures that your changes are saved to the output PSD file.
## Step 6: Delete Temporary File
```csharp
File.Delete(outputPsd);
```
This step removes the temporary PSD file created during the process.
## Step 7: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SupportOfAnimatedDataSection executed successfully");
```
This informs the user that the execution was successful.
## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to handle animated data sections in Aspose.PSD for .NET. This skill can be invaluable in creating dynamic and engaging PSD images with precise control over animation.
