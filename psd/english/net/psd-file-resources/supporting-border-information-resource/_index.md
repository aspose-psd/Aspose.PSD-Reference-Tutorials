# Supporting Border Information Resource in Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction
Welcome to our step-by-step guide on utilizing the Border Information Resource feature in Aspose.PSD for .NET. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of working with Border Information Resources using Aspose.PSD, a powerful .NET imaging library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this tutorial aims to provide clarity on incorporating Border Information Resources seamlessly into your projects.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- Aspose.PSD for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.PSD library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.PSD website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- .NET Development Environment: Set up your .NET development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
## Import Namespaces
In your code, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.PSD:
```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Resources;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Resources.ResolutionEnums;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Set Your Document and Output Directories
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string SourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
string OutputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the PSD Image
```csharp
//ExStart
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(SourceDir, "BorderInformationResourceInput.psd");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, "BorderInformationResourceOutput.psd");
using (var image = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFilePath))
{
```
## Step 3: Access Image Resources
```csharp
ResourceBlock[] imageResources = image.ImageResources;
BorderInformationResource borderInfoResource = null;
foreach (var imageResource in imageResources)
{
    if (imageResource is BorderInformationResource)
    {
        borderInfoResource = (BorderInformationResource)imageResource;
        break;
    }
}
```
## Step 4: Update Border Information Resource
```csharp
// update BorderInformationResource
borderInfoResource.Width = 0.1;
borderInfoResource.Unit = PhysicalUnit.Inches;
image.Save(outputFilePath);
```
## Step 5: Finalize and Execute
```csharp
//ExEnd
}
Console.WriteLine("SupportOfBackgroundColorResource executed successfully");
```
By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate the Border Information Resource feature into your Aspose.PSD for .NET project.
## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use Border Information Resources with Aspose.PSD for .NET. Experiment with different parameters and explore the extensive capabilities of this library to enhance your imaging projects.
