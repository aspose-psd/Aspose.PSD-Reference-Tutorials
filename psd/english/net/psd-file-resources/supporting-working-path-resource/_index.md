# Supporting Working Path Resource in Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction
If you're a .NET developer working with image processing, Aspose.PSD for .NET is your go-to solution. In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into harnessing the power of the 'WorkingPathResource' resource in Aspose.PSD. This crucial feature enhances the precision of the Crop operation, ensuring your images are tailored exactly as needed.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET development.
- Aspose.PSD for .NET library installed. If not, download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- A working environment set up with your preferred IDE.
## Import Namespaces
In your project, make sure to import the necessary namespaces for Aspose.PSD:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Core.VectorPaths;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Resources;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Working Directories
Begin by defining your document and output directories:
```csharp
string baseFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFolder = "Your Output Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load and Crop Image
Now, let's get into the core functionality. Load your PSD file, search for the 'WorkingPathResource' resource, and perform a crop operation:
```csharp
string sourceFile = Path.Combine(baseFolder, "WorkingPathResourceInput.psd");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "WorkingPathResourceOutput.psd");
using (var psdImage = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFile))
{
    // Search WorkingPathResource resource.
    ResourceBlock[] imageResources = psdImage.ImageResources;
    WorkingPathResource workingPathResource = null;
    // ... (continue checking for the WorkingPathResource)
    
    // Crop and save.
    psdImage.Crop(0, 500, 0, 200);
    psdImage.Save(outputFile);
}
```
## Step 3: Verify Changes
After the crop operation, load the saved image and confirm the alterations:
```csharp
using (var psdImage = (PsdImage)Image.Load(outputFile))
{
    // Search WorkingPathResource resource.
    ResourceBlock[] imageResources = psdImage.ImageResources;
    WorkingPathResource workingPathResource = null;
    // ... (continue checking for the WorkingPathResource)
    // Verify changes.
    BezierKnotRecord record = workingPathResource.Paths[3] as BezierKnotRecord;
    if (record.Points[0].X != 4630510 || record.Points[0].Y != 22761088)
    {
        throw new Exception("Values are incorrect.");
    }
}
```
## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully mastered the use of 'WorkingPathResource' in Aspose.PSD for .NET. This feature elevates your image processing capabilities, ensuring precision and efficiency in your projects.
