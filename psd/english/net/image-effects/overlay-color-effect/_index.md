# Overlaying Color Effects on Images in Aspose.PSD for .NET

## Introduction

Aspose.PSD for .NET provides a robust set of features for image processing, allowing developers to achieve stunning effects effortlessly. One such capability is overlaying color effects on images. In this tutorial, we'll focus on the ColorOverlay effect and demonstrate how to apply it to an image, transforming its visual appeal.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PSD for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/net/).
- Your Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your source and output files.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.LayerEffects;
using Aspose.PSD.ImageLoadOptions;
using System;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Load the Image

```csharp
string sourceFileName = dataDir + "ColorOverlay.psd";
var loadOptions = new PsdLoadOptions()
{
    LoadEffectsResource = true
};

using (var im = (PsdImage)Image.Load(sourceFileName, loadOptions))
{
    // Your code for further steps will go here
}
```

## Step 2: Access ColorOverlay Effect

```csharp
var colorOverlay = (ColorOverlayEffect)(im.Layers[1].BlendingOptions.Effects[0]);
```

## Step 3: Verify and Modify ColorOverlay Settings

```csharp
if (colorOverlay.Color != Color.Red || colorOverlay.Opacity != 153)
{
    throw new Exception("Color overlay read wrong");
}

colorOverlay.Color = Color.Green;
colorOverlay.Opacity = 128;
```

## Step 4: Save the Modified Image

```csharp
string psdPathAfterChange = dataDir + "ColorOverlayChanged.psd";
im.Save(psdPathAfterChange);
```

By following these steps, you've successfully applied a ColorOverlay effect to your image using Aspose.PSD for .NET.
