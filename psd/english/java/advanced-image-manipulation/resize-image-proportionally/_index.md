# How to Convert PSD to PNG and Resize Proportionally with Aspose.PSD for Java

## Introduction

If you need to **convert PSD to PNG** while keeping the original aspect ratio, you’ve landed in the right place. In this tutorial we’ll walk through a complete **Aspose.PSD tutorial** that shows you **how to resize image** files proportionally in Java, cache the image for optimal performance, and finally save the result as a PNG. By the end you’ll be able to integrate this workflow into any Java‑based image‑processing pipeline.

## Quick Answers
- **Can Aspose.PSD convert PSD to PNG?** Yes – simply load the PSD and save it with `PngOptions`.
- **Does the library support proportional resizing?** Absolutely; use `resizeWidthProportionally` and `resizeHeightProportionally`.
- **Do I need to cache the image first?** Caching (`image.cacheData()`) improves performance for large PSD files.
- **What Java version is required?** Java 8 or newer is fully supported.
- **Is a license required for production?** Yes, a commercial license removes evaluation watermarks.

## What is “convert PSD to PNG” and why does it matter?

Converting a Photoshop document (PSD) to a portable network graphics (PNG) file lets you share layered designs as a lightweight, web‑friendly format. PNG retains transparency and lossless quality, making it ideal for UI assets, thumbnails, or any scenario where image fidelity matters.

## Why resize image proportionally in Java?

Resizing **how to resize image** without distorting its aspect ratio ensures that graphics look natural on different screens. The `Aspose.PSD` API provides dedicated methods for proportional scaling, which automatically calculate the matching height or width, saving you from manual math errors.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into code, make sure you have:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** – Java 8 or later installed.
2. **Aspose.PSD for Java** – download the latest JAR from the official site [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
3. A sample PSD file (`sample.psd`) placed in a directory you can reference from your project.

## Import Packages

Add the necessary imports to your Java class. These classes give you access to image loading, caching, resizing, and PNG output options.

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PngOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the PSD Image

First, load the source PSD file. If the file is large, caching the image data reduces memory churn when you perform subsequent operations.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String sourceFile = dataDir + "sample.psd";

Image image = Image.load(sourceFile);

if (!image.isCached()) {
    // Image caching java – improves performance for large files
    image.cacheData();
}
```

## Step 2: Resize Image Proportionally (Java)

Now decide the new dimensions. In this example we shrink the image to **half** its original size while preserving the aspect ratio. You can adjust the target width or height as needed.

```java
int newWidth = image.getWidth() / 2;
image.resizeWidthProportionally(newWidth);

int newHeight = image.getHeight() / 2;
image.resizeHeightProportionally(newHeight);
```

> **Pro tip:** Use either `resizeWidthProportionally` *or* `resizeHeightProportionally`—the library automatically calculates the other dimension to keep the image proportional.

## Step 3: Save the Resized Image as PNG

Finally, export the resized image to PNG format. This step completes the **convert PSD to PNG** workflow.

```java
String destName = dataDir + "SimpleResizeImageProportionally_out.png";
image.save(destName, new PngOptions());
```

When the code runs, you’ll find a PNG file that is half the size of the original PSD, with the same visual quality and no distortion.

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **OutOfMemoryError** | Large PSD not cached | Call `image.cacheData()` before resizing |
| **Blank PNG output** | Incorrect file path | Verify `dataDir` and write permissions |
| **Aspect ratio looks off** | Using both width and height manually | Use the proportional methods provided by Aspose.PSD |
