# Force Font Cache with Aspose.PSD for Java

## Introduction

Are you looking to optimize font caching with Aspose.PSD for Java? Font caching plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of your Java applications, especially when dealing with complex image processing tasks. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of forcing font cache using Aspose.PSD for Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with Java image processing, this tutorial is designed to help you seamlessly integrate font caching into your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library downloaded from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
- A sample PSD file for testing purposes.

Now that you have everything set up, let's proceed with the tutorial.

## Import Packages

Firstly, you need to import the necessary packages to leverage Aspose.PSD for Java functionalities in your project. Add the following import statements to your Java class:

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.OpenTypeFontsCache;

import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import java.io.Console;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
```

## Step 1: Load the PSD Image

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.load(dataDir + "sample.psd");
image.save(dataDir + "NoFont.psd");
```

In this step, we load a sample PSD image and save it without any font changes. This helps us establish a baseline for the font caching process.

## Step 2: Wait for Font Installation

```java
System.out.println("You have 2 minutes to install the font");
Thread.sleep(2 * 60 * 1000);
OpenTypeFontsCache.updateCache();
```

This step introduces a delay, giving users two minutes to install the required font. The `updateCache()` method updates the font cache based on the installed font.

## Step 3: Load the Updated PSD Image

```java
PsdImage image1 = (PsdImage)Image.load(dataDir + "sample.psd");
image1.save(dataDir + "HasFont.psd");
```

After the font installation delay, load the PSD image again. This time, the updated cache ensures that the image is saved with the installed font.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully forced font cache using Aspose.PSD for Java. Font caching is an essential aspect of optimizing image processing, and Aspose.PSD makes it seamless for Java developers.
