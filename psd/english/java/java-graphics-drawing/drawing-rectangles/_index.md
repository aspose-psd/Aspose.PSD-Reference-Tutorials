# Drawing Rectangles in Java

## Introduction
In the world of Java development, manipulating and generating images programmatically is a common requirement across various applications. One such task often encountered is drawing shapes like rectangles onto images. Aspose.PSD for Java provides a robust set of tools and functionalities to accomplish this efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the process of drawing rectangles on an image using Aspose.PSD for Java, step-by-step.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
### Java Development Environment
Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system, preferably JDK 8 or higher.
### Aspose.PSD for Java
You need to have Aspose.PSD for Java library. You can download it from the [Aspose.PSD for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/) and follow the installation instructions provided in their documentation.
## Import Packages
To begin, import the necessary Aspose.PSD for Java packages into your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Graphics;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.Pen;
import com.aspose.psd.Rectangle;
import com.aspose.psd.brushes.SolidBrush;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.BmpOptions;
```
These imports will allow you to access the classes and methods needed to draw rectangles on images.
## Step 1: Create a New Image
First, create a new instance of the `PsdImage` class with a specific width and height.
```java
String dataDir = "path_to_your_data_directory/";
String outpath = dataDir + "Rectangle.bmp";
// Create an instance of BmpOptions and set its properties
BmpOptions saveOptions = new BmpOptions();
saveOptions.setBitsPerPixel(32);
// Create an instance of PsdImage with specified dimensions
Image image = new PsdImage(100, 100);
```
In this step, `PsdImage` is initialized with a width and height of 100 pixels each.
## Step 2: Initialize Graphics Object
Next, initialize a `Graphics` object using the `image` created in the previous step.
```java
// Initialize Graphics object
Graphics graphic = new Graphics(image);
```
This `Graphics` object will be used to perform drawing operations on the image.
## Step 3: Clear Graphics Surface
Clear the graphics surface of the image using a specific color.
```java
// Clear graphics surface with a yellow color
graphic.clear(Color.YELLOW);
```
This sets the background of the image to yellow.
## Step 4: Draw Rectangles
Now, draw rectangles on the image using different colors and dimensions.
```java
// Draw a red rectangle
graphic.drawRectangle(new Pen(Color.RED), new Rectangle(30, 10, 40, 80));
// Draw a blue rectangle
graphic.drawRectangle(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.BLUE)), new Rectangle(10, 30, 80, 40));
```
These commands draw rectangles with specified colors (red and blue) and positions on the image.
## Step 5: Export Image
Finally, save the modified image to a BMP file format.
```java
// Export image to BMP file format
image.save(outpath, saveOptions);
```
This saves the image with drawn rectangles to a BMP file specified by `outpath`.

## Conclusion
Drawing rectangles programmatically on images in Java using Aspose.PSD for Java is straightforward with the right tools and libraries. By following this tutorial, you've learned how to initialize an image, manipulate graphics objects, draw shapes, and save the modified image to a file. Experimenting with different shapes, colors, and dimensions will further enhance your understanding of image manipulation in Java.
