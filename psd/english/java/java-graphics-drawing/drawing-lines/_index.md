# Drawing Lines in Java

## Introduction
In the realm of Java development, manipulating and creating PSD (Photoshop Document) files programmatically is a powerful capability. Aspose.PSD for Java empowers developers to perform various tasks such as drawing lines, shapes, and images directly within PSD files. This tutorial will guide you through the process of drawing lines using Aspose.PSD for Java, providing clear steps and examples to help you get started quickly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library downloaded and set up in your development environment.
## Import Packages
First, ensure you have imported the necessary Aspose.PSD for Java packages into your project:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Graphics;
import static com.aspose.psd.GraphicsUnit.Point;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.Pen;
import com.aspose.psd.Point;
import com.aspose.psd.brushes.SolidBrush;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.BmpOptions;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Begin by creating a new Java project in your IDE and adding Aspose.PSD for Java to your dependencies. You can download the library from [Aspose.PSD for Java Download](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
## Step 2: Initialize PSD Image
Initialize a PSD image with a specified width and height:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String outpath = dataDir + "Lines.psd";
Image image = new PsdImage(100, 100);
```
## Step 3: Initialize Graphics Object
Create an instance of the Graphics class and clear the graphics surface:
```java
Graphics graphic = new Graphics(image);
graphic.clear(Color.getYellow());
```
## Step 4: Draw Diagonal Dotted Lines
Draw two diagonal dotted lines using a blue Pen object:
```java
graphic.drawLine(new Pen(Color.getBlue()), 9, 9, 90, 90);
graphic.drawLine(new Pen(Color.getBlue()), 9, 90, 90, 9);
```
## Step 5: Draw Continuous Lines
Draw four continuous lines using Pen objects with different colors:
```java
graphic.drawLine(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.getRed())), new Point(9, 9), new Point(9, 90));
graphic.drawLine(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.getAqua())), new Point(9, 90), new Point(90, 90));
graphic.drawLine(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.getBlack())), new Point(90, 90), new Point(90, 9));
graphic.drawLine(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.getWhite())), new Point(90, 9), new Point(9, 9));
```
## Step 6: Save the Image
Finally, save the modified PSD image to a specified path:
```java
image.save(outpath);
```
## Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully drawn lines within a PSD file using Aspose.PSD for Java. This tutorial covered initializing a PSD image, setting up graphics, drawing various types of lines, and saving the resulting image.
