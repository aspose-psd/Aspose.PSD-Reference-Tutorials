# Convert PSB to PSD in Java

## Introduction
In the realm of Java development, manipulating graphic files efficiently is crucial. This tutorial focuses on leveraging Aspose.PSD for Java to seamlessly convert PSB (Photoshop Big) files to PSD (Photoshop Document) format. By following these steps, you can integrate this capability into your Java applications effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK 8 or above is installed on your system.
- Aspose.PSD for Java Library: Download and configure the Aspose.PSD for Java library. You can obtain it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or another Java IDE of your choice.
- Basic Familiarity with Java: Understanding of Java programming basics will be beneficial.
## Import Packages
First, import the necessary Aspose.PSD classes in your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.FileFormatVersion;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Variables and Load PSB File
Start by defining variables and loading the PSB file:
```java
String dataDir = "Your_Document_Directory/";
String sourceFileName = dataDir + "2layers.psb";
PsdImage image = (PsdImage)Image.load(sourceFileName);
```
Ensure to replace `"Your_Document_Directory/"` with the path to your actual document directory containing the PSB file.
## Step 2: Configure PSD Conversion Options
Next, configure the PSD conversion options:
```java
PsdOptions options = new PsdOptions();
options.setFileFormatVersion(FileFormatVersion.Psd);
```
Here, `FileFormatVersion.Psd` ensures the output file is in PSD format.
## Step 3: Save the Converted PSD File
Save the converted PSD file using the loaded PSB image and options:
```java
image.save(dataDir + "ConvertFromPsb_out.psd", options);
```
Replace `"ConvertFromPsb_out.psd"` with your desired output file name and path.
