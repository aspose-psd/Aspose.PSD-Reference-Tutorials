# Convert AI to PSD in Java

## Introduction
Are you looking to convert AI (Adobe Illustrator) files to PSD (Adobe Photoshop) files using Java? Well, you're in the right place! Today, we'll explore how to accomplish this task using the powerful Aspose.PSD for Java library. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from prerequisites to detailed step-by-step instructions. Let's dive in and transform your design files seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, there are a few things you need to have in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
2. Aspose.PSD for Java: Download the Aspose.PSD for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to write and execute your Java code.
4. AI File: The Adobe Illustrator file you want to convert.
5. Aspose Temporary License (Optional): For full functionality without limitations, you can obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
## Import Packages
First, let's set up our project by importing the necessary packages. You'll need to include Aspose.PSD for Java in your project's classpath. Here’s how to do it:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.ai.AiImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
```
Alternatively, you can download the JAR file from the [Aspose.PSD for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/) and add it to your project manually.
Let's break down the process into simple, manageable steps.
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
First, set up your project in your preferred IDE.
### Create a New Project
1. Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
2. Name your project something meaningful, like "AItoPSDConverter."
### Add Aspose.PSD Library
1. If you downloaded the JAR file, add it to your project’s build path.
2. If using Maven, ensure the dependency is correctly added to your `pom.xml`.
## Step 2: Loading the AI File
Now that your project is set up, let's load the AI file you want to convert.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; 
String sourceFileName = dataDir + "34992OStroke.ai";       
AiImage image = (AiImage) Image.load(sourceFileName);
```
## Step 3: Setting PSD Options
Next, we need to set the options for our PSD output.
```java
PsdOptions options = new PsdOptions();
```
## Step 4: Saving the AI File as PSD
With the AI file loaded and options set, we can now save it as a PSD file.
```java
String outFileName = dataDir + "34992OStroke.psd";
image.save(outFileName, options);
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully converted an AI file to a PSD file using Aspose.PSD for Java. This powerful library makes it straightforward to handle complex file conversions in your Java applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide should help you integrate AI to PSD conversion functionality into your projects with ease.
