## Introduction
Are you working with Adobe Illustrator files and need to convert them to PDF format in your Java application? Whether you're handling vector graphics, illustrations, or design files, converting AI files to PDFs can be crucial for documentation, sharing, and printing purposes. In this guide, we’ll explore how you can effortlessly convert AI files to PDF using Aspose.PSD for Java. Aspose.PSD is a powerful library that simplifies the manipulation and conversion of PSD, AI, and other image formats. So, let’s dive into the nuts and bolts of this conversion process!
## Prerequisites
Before we get started with the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.PSD for Java Library: Download and include Aspose.PSD for Java in your project. You can get the library from [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
3. IDE Setup: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for easier code management.
## Import Packages
To get started with the code, you need to import the necessary Aspose.PSD packages. Here’s how you can do it:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.ai.AiImage;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```
These imports bring in the classes required to load and convert AI files to PDFs. Now, let’s walk through the steps in detail.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First things first, make sure you have your environment set up. Here’s a snippet to initialize the directory and file paths:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; 
String sourceFileName = dataDir + "34992OStroke.ai";
String outFileName = dataDir + "34992OStroke.pdf";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your AI file is located. This step ensures you have the correct paths to your source and destination files.
## Step 2: Load the AI Image
Next, you need to load your AI file using Aspose.PSD. This is how you can do it:
```java
AiImage image = (AiImage) Image.load(sourceFileName);
```
This line of code reads the AI file into an `AiImage` object, making it ready for conversion. The `Image.load()` method takes the file path as an argument.
## Step 3: Configure PDF Options
Before saving the image as a PDF, you can configure PDF-specific options. Here’s how you can set up `PdfOptions`:
```java
PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions();
```
You can customize `PdfOptions` to control aspects like compression, resolution, and page size. For instance:
```java
options.setJpegQuality(100);
```
This sets the JPEG quality for any images within the PDF to the maximum level.
## Step 4: Save as PDF
Now comes the exciting part – saving your AI file as a PDF. Use the `save()` method of the `AiImage` object:
```java
image.save(outFileName, options);
```
This line will convert your AI image to a PDF file at the specified path. Ensure that `outFileName` points to the desired output location.

## Conclusion
Converting AI files to PDFs in Java using Aspose.PSD is straightforward and efficient. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily integrate this functionality into your applications, making it simple to handle vector graphics and illustrations in PDF format. Whether you’re a developer, a designer, or just exploring the possibilities of AI and PDF conversions, Aspose.PSD offers a seamless experience.
