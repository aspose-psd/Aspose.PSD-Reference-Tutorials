# Apply Adjustment Layers in PSD Files using Java

## Introduction
Are you a Java developer looking to enhance images stored in PSD files? If so, you're in the right place! In this article, we'll explore how to apply adjustment layers in PSD files using the Aspose.PSD library for Java. Whether you’re working on a personal project or a professional application, understanding how to manipulate PSD files can significantly elevate your software's capabilities. 

## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code and start applying those adjustment layers, there are a few prerequisites you'll need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle’s website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.PSD Library: If you haven't already, you'll need to download the Aspose.PSD library for Java. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
3. Development Environment: Set up a Java integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse where you'll be writing and running your code.
4. Basic Familiarity with Java: A general understanding of Java programming will help you follow along smoothly.
5. PSD Files: Have a couple of PSD files on hand for testing purposes. You can create some using Adobe Photoshop or download sample files from the internet.
## Import Packages
Before we start coding, let’s clarify which packages we need to import. Aspose.PSD allows us to work with Photoshop files in a range of ways, so let’s grab the necessary classes to handle PSD images and adjustment layers.
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.adjustmentlayers.AdjustmentLayer;
```
Now that we have our packages in place, let’s break down the examples step-by-step!
## Step 1: Load the PSD File
The first step in our journey is to load the PSD file. This is the file we’ll be working with to apply our adjustment layers.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String sourceFileName1 = dataDir + "ChannelMixerAdjustmentLayer.psd";
PsdImage im = (PsdImage) Image.load(sourceFileName1);
```
In this snippet, we define the directory where our PSD files are located and load the specific file we want to manipulate. Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your PSD files on your machine.
## Step 2: Iterate Over Layers
Now that we’ve loaded the PSD file, we'll want to iterate through its layers to find our adjustment layers.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < im.getLayers().length; i++) {
    if (im.getLayers()[i] instanceof AdjustmentLayer) {
        AdjustmentLayer adjustmentLayer = (AdjustmentLayer) im.getLayers()[i];
        
        if (adjustmentLayer != null) {
            adjustmentLayer.mergeLayerTo(im.getLayers()[0]);
        }
    }
}
```
In this step, we loop through each layer in the PSD file to identify any that are of the `AdjustmentLayer` type. If we find one, we merge it with the base layer, which is usually the first layer (`im.getLayers()[0]`). This merging process effectively applies the adjustments to our image. 
## Step 3: Save the Modified PSD File
After modifying the layers, it’s crucial to save the changes we’ve made. Let’s do this in the next step.
```java
String exportPath1 = dataDir + "ChannelMixerAdjustmentLayerChanged.psd";
im.save(exportPath1);
```
Here, we specify the export path for our amended PSD file and call the `save()` method to write our changes to disk.
## Step 4: Levels Adjustment Layer
Let’s repeat the process for a different type of adjustment layer: the Levels adjustment layer. 
### Load the Levels Adjustment Layer PSD
```java
String sourceFileName2 = dataDir + "LevelsAdjustmentLayerRgb.psd";
PsdImage img = (PsdImage) Image.load(sourceFileName2);
```
As before, we load the PSD file containing our Levels adjustment layer. 
### Iterate Through Levels Layers
Next, we will loop through the layers again, just like we did previously, but now we’re working with another PSD file.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < img.getLayers().length; i++) {
    if (img.getLayers()[i] instanceof AdjustmentLayer) {
        AdjustmentLayer adjustmentLayer = (AdjustmentLayer) img.getLayers()[i];
        
        if (adjustmentLayer != null) {
            adjustmentLayer.mergeLayerTo(img.getLayers()[0]);
        }
    }
}
```
This code acts similarly to the previous iteration; it searches for adjustment layers within the current PSD file, allowing us to apply any adjustments available.
## Save the Levels Adjustment Layer PSD
Finally, we’ll save this new file after applying the adjustments.
```java
String exportPath2 = dataDir + "LevelsAdjustmentLayerRgbChanged.psd";
img.save(exportPath2);
```
Now, we have successfully processed the Levels adjustment layer!
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've just learned how to apply adjustment layers in PSD files using Java and the Aspose.PSD library. Whether you were tweaking colors or adjusting levels, you now have the foundational skills to manipulate PSD files programmatically.
Using Aspose.PSD can significantly streamline workflows in image editing, allowing for automation and customization in ways that traditional tools might not. Don't hesitate to explore the library further and experiment with different types of layers to see what creative possibilities are out there.
