# Create Indexed PSD Files using Aspose.PSD for Java

## Introduction
Creating graphics programmatically is not just an art; it’s a blend of technology and imagination. One powerful tool in this creative domain is Aspose.PSD for Java, an immensely capable library that allows developers to manipulate Photoshop documents. In this tutorial, we’re going to dive deep into creating indexed PSD files using Aspose.PSD, complete with a step-by-step guide to get you started. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, this guide will walk you through the process seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let’s cover what you need to get started. Following these prerequisites ensures you’ll have a smooth sailing experience while learning.
### 1. Basic Knowledge of Java
Familiarity with Java syntax is essential as all our examples will be in this language. Understanding fundamental concepts such as classes and methods will make following along much easier.
### 2. Java Development Environment
Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Ideally, you should have version 8 or later to use the latest features of Aspose.PSD.
### 3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse can significantly ease your development process. These environments offer integrated tools for coding, debugging, and more.
### 4. Aspose.PSD for Java Library
You’ll need to download and add the Aspose.PSD for Java library to your project. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
### 5. Basic Knowledge of Graphic Design Concepts
Understanding graphics concepts such as color modes and shapes will help you grasp the tutorial better.
## Import Packages
Before we proceed with the code, let’s make sure we have all the necessary packages imported into your Java application. Here’s what you’ll need:
```java
import com.aspose.psd.Color;
import com.aspose.psd.Graphics;
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.Pen;
import com.aspose.psd.Rectangle;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.ColorModes;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.CompressionMethod;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdColorPalette;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.FileCreateSource;
```
These imports will allow you to work with PSD options, colors, and graphics manipulation through Aspose.PSD.

Now, let’s break down the code step-by-step to create indexed PSD files. We’ll take it one piece at a time to ensure clarity.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory
The first thing you’ll need to do is set up your document directory where the PSD files will be saved. A good starting point in your code would be:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you’d like to save your PSD file. For example, it could be `"/Users/YourName/Documents/"`.
## Step 2: Create an Instance of PsdOptions
Here, we will create an instance of `PsdOptions`, which will dictate how our PSD file will be generated.
```java
PsdOptions createOptions = new PsdOptions();
```
This `createOptions` object will hold all the properties we need to define the file's settings. 
## Step 3: Set Properties of PsdOptions
Next, we’ll configure our `PsdOptions` object. Specifically, we’ll set the source file, color mode, and version. 
```java
createOptions.setSource(new FileCreateSource(dataDir + "Newsample_out.psd", false));
createOptions.setColorMode(ColorModes.Indexed);
createOptions.setVersion(5);
```
- Source: Defines the location of our new PSD file.
- Color Mode: Setting it to `Indexed` optimizes the file for color usage.
- Version: Specifies the version of the PSD file format.
## Step 4: Create a Color Palette
Creating a vibrant color palette is crucial for an indexed PSD file. Let’s define a simple palette with RGB colors.
```java
Color[] palette = { Color.getRed(), Color.getGreen(), Color.getBlue(), Color.getYellow() };
createOptions.setPalette(new PsdColorPalette(palette));
createOptions.setCompressionMethod(CompressionMethod.RLE);
```
Here’s what’s happening:
- We create an array of colors.
- Assign it as the palette for our PSD using `setPalette()`.
- We also set the compression method to RLE for optimized file storage.
## Step 5: Create the PSD Image
At this point, we are ready to create our PSD file using the options we’ve configured.
```java
Image psd = Image.create(createOptions, 500, 500);
```
This line generates the new PSD with a canvas size of 500x500 pixels.
## Step 6: Draw Graphics on the PSD
Let’s add some graphics to our newly created PSD file. For this example, we will create a simple red ellipse.
```java
Graphics graphics = new Graphics(psd);
graphics.clear(Color.getWhite());
graphics.drawEllipse(new Pen(Color.getRed(), 6), new Rectangle(0, 0, 400, 400));
```
Here’s the breakdown:
- We create a `Graphics` object that allows us to draw on our PSD image.
- `clear(Color.getWhite())` fills the background with white.
- `drawEllipse()` creates a red ellipse with specified dimensions.
## Step 7: Save the PSD File
Finally, it’s time to save your masterpiece. After all, what’s the point of creating if you can't share?
```java
psd.save();
```
Executing this line will save the PSD file in the specified directory with the configurations we have set.
## Conclusion
