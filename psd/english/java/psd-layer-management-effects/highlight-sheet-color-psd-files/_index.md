## Introduction

Are you looking to dive into image manipulation and enhance your digital creations using Java? Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, working with PSD files can open up a world of possibilities. PSD files are the industry standard for layered image editing, and with the power of Aspose.PSD for Java, you can effortlessly manipulate these files within your Java applications. Today, we’ll walk through how to highlight sheet colors in PSD files, ensuring your designs stand out in the most vibrant way possible.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's ensure you have everything you need to follow along smoothly. Here's a checklist of what you'll need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans will make coding easier. Choose one that you're comfortable with.
- Aspose.PSD for Java Library: This is the star of the show! You’ll need to download and reference the Aspose.PSD for Java library in your project. You can get it from [Aspose's website](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).
- Sample PSD File: We’ll use a sample PSD file named `SheetColorHighlightExample.psd` for this tutorial. You can create your own or download a sample from the internet.
- Basic Knowledge of Java: A fundamental understanding of Java programming is essential to follow this tutorial.

With everything in place, let's move on to importing the necessary packages and getting your project ready.

## Import Packages

First things first, let's import the required packages to kickstart our project. These imports will allow us to work with PSD files and manipulate them effectively using Aspose.PSD for Java.

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;
import com.aspose.psd.examples.Utils.Assert;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.PsdImage;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.Layer;
import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.layerresources.SheetColorHighlightEnum;
```

These imports bring in the necessary classes and methods that we'll use to manipulate PSD files, specifically for highlighting sheet colors.

## Step 1: Load the PSD File

The first step in our tutorial is to load the PSD file that you want to manipulate. We'll be using the `PsdImage` class from Aspose.PSD for Java to load the file into our application.

### Step 1.1: Define the File Paths

Before loading the file, let's define the file paths for the source and the output PSD files. We'll use a string variable to store the directory path where your files are located.

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

String sourceFileName = dataDir + "SheetColorHighlightExample.psd";
String exportPath = dataDir + "SheetColorHighlightExampleChanged.psd";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PSD file is stored. This setup ensures that your application knows where to find the file and where to save the modified version.

### Step 1.2: Load the PSD File

Now that we have our file paths defined, let's load the PSD file using the `Image.load()` method and cast it to a `PsdImage`.

```java
PsdImage im = (PsdImage)Image.load(sourceFileName);
```

This line of code loads the PSD file and prepares it for manipulation by casting it into a `PsdImage` object, which is specifically designed to handle PSD files in Aspose.PSD for Java.

## Step 2: Access and Manipulate Layers

In PSD files, layers are where the magic happens. They allow you to separate different elements of your design and manipulate them independently. In this step, we'll access the layers of our PSD file and check their current sheet color highlights.

### Step 2.1: Access the First Layer

Let's start by accessing the first layer of the PSD file and checking its current sheet color highlight.

```java
Layer layer1 = im.getLayers()[0];
Assert.areEqual(SheetColorHighlightEnum.Violet, layer1.getSheetColorHighlight());
```

Here, we're accessing the first layer in the PSD file using the `getLayers()` method. We then use `Assert.areEqual()` to verify that the sheet color highlight of this layer is set to Violet. This step is crucial to ensure that we're working with the correct layer.

### Step 2.2: Access the Second Layer

Next, we'll access the second layer and check its sheet color highlight as well.

```java
Layer layer2 = im.getLayers()[1];
Assert.areEqual(SheetColorHighlightEnum.Orange, layer2.getSheetColorHighlight());
```

Similarly, we access the second layer and verify that its sheet color highlight is set to Orange. By checking these highlights, we can ensure that each layer is correctly identified before we make any changes.

## Step 3: Modify the Sheet Color Highlight

Now that we've identified the layers and their current sheet color highlights, it's time to modify one of them. In this step, we'll change the sheet color highlight of the first layer.

### Step 3.1: Set New Sheet Color Highlight

To make our design pop, let's change the sheet color highlight of the first layer to Yellow.

```java
layer1.setSheetColorHighlight(SheetColorHighlightEnum.Yellow);
```

This line of code changes the sheet color highlight of the first layer to Yellow. It’s a simple yet powerful way to make your design elements stand out.

## Step 4: Save the Modified PSD File

After modifying the sheet color highlight, the final step is to save the changes to a new PSD file. This ensures that your original file remains intact while your changes are saved separately.

### Step 4.1: Save the File

Let's save the modified PSD file to the path we defined earlier.

```java
im.save(exportPath);
```

This command saves your modifications to a new PSD file located at the `exportPath` you set earlier. Now you have both the original and the modified files, allowing you to compare the changes side by side.

## Conclusion
