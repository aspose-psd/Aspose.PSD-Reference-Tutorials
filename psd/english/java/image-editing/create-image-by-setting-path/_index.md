# Create Image by Setting Path in Aspose.PSD for Java

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on creating images using Aspose.PSD for Java. In this guide, we will explore how to set the path and configure options to generate a PSD image. Aspose.PSD is a powerful Java library for working with Photoshop files, providing a seamless way to manipulate and create images programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.PSD for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project:

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.CompressionMethod;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.FileCreateSource;

```

## Step 1: Set Document Directory Path

Set up the path for your document directory where the image will be created.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Define Output File Name

Define the output file name, including the document directory.

```java
String desName = dataDir + "CreatingAnImageBySettingPath_out.psd";
```

## Step 3: Configure PsdOptions

Create an instance of PsdOptions and configure its properties, such as compression method.

```java
PsdOptions psdOptions = new PsdOptions();
psdOptions.setCompressionMethod(CompressionMethod.RLE);
```

## Step 4: Set Source Property

Define the source property for the PsdOptions instance, specifying the output file and whether it is temporary.

```java
psdOptions.setSource(new FileCreateSource(desName, false));
```

## Step 5: Create Image

Create an instance of Image and call the Create method by passing the PsdOptions object and image dimensions.

```java
Image image = Image.create(psdOptions, 500, 500);
```

## Step 6: Save the Image

Save the created image.

```java
image.save();
```

Repeat these steps, and you've successfully created an image using Aspose.PSD for Java by setting the path.
