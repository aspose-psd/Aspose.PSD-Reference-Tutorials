# How to Create PSD – Create Image by Setting Path in Aspose.PSD for Java

## Introduction

Welcome to this step‑by‑step tutorial on **how to create PSD** images using Aspose.PSD for Java. We'll walk you through setting the file path, configuring options, and generating a Photoshop document programmatically. By the end, you'll understand how to **java create photoshop document** files that can be further edited or integrated into your applications.

## Quick Answers
- **What does Aspose.PSD do?** It provides a pure‑Java API to read, edit, and create Photoshop (PSD) files without needing Photoshop installed.  
- **Can I set a custom output path?** Yes – use `FileCreateSource` to specify the exact location and file name.  
- **Which compression methods are supported?** RLE, ZIP, and RAW; this example uses RLE for lossless compression.  
- **Do I need a license for development?** A free trial works for testing; a commercial license is required for production.  
- **What Java versions are supported?** Aspose.PSD works with Java 8 and later.

## What is “how to create PSD”?

Creating a PSD file means generating a Photoshop‑compatible image that retains layers, channels, and other Photoshop‑specific data. Aspose.PSD abstracts the complex file format, letting you focus on your business logic.

## Why use Java to **java create photoshop document**?

- **Cross‑platform** – Java runs anywhere, so your PSD generation works on Windows, Linux, or macOS.  
- **No Photoshop dependency** – Generate or modify PSD files without installing Adobe Photoshop.  
- **Full control** – Set compression, color mode, dimensions, and more through a clean object model.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.  
- Aspose.PSD for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/psd/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project:

```java
import com.aspose.psd.Image;

import com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.CompressionMethod;
import com.aspose.psd.imageoptions.PsdOptions;
import com.aspose.psd.sources.FileCreateSource;
```

## Step 1: How to Set Path for Document Directory

Set up the path for your document directory where the image will be created.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Define Output File Name

Define the output file name, including the document directory.

```java
String desName = dataDir + "CreatingAnImageBySettingPath_out.psd";
```

## Step 3: Configure PsdOptions

Create an instance of `PsdOptions` and configure its properties, such as compression method.

```java
PsdOptions psdOptions = new PsdOptions();
psdOptions.setCompressionMethod(CompressionMethod.RLE);
```

## Step 4: Set Source Property

Define the source property for the `PsdOptions` instance, specifying the output file and whether it is temporary.

```java
psdOptions.setSource(new FileCreateSource(desName, false));
```

## Step 5: Create Image

Create an instance of `Image` and call the `create` method by passing the `PsdOptions` object and image dimensions.

```java
Image image = Image.create(psdOptions, 500, 500);
```

## Step 6: Save the Image

Save the created image.

```java
image.save();
```

Repeat these steps, and you've successfully created an image using Aspose.PSD for Java by setting the path.

## Common Issues & Tips

- **Invalid directory** – Ensure `dataDir` ends with the appropriate file separator (`/` or `\\`).  
- **Permission errors** – Run your application with write permissions for the target folder.  
- **License not set** – If you receive a licensing exception, load your Aspose.PSD license before creating the image.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we covered **how to create PSD** files with Aspose.PSD for Java, demonstrated **how to set path**, and showed a complete flow for generating a Photoshop document. This approach lets Java developers embed PSD creation directly into their workflows, whether for automated reporting, dynamic graphics, or batch processing.
