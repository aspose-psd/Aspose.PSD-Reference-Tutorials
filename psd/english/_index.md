## Advanced Image Manipulation Techniques
Below are quick, practical guides for the most common **advanced image manipulation** tasks that developers ask about.

### How to Convert PSD to PNG
Aspose.PSD lets you load a PSD file and save it directly as PNG while preserving transparency and layer effects. This is ideal for web‑ready assets.

### How to Save PSD as JPEG
When you need a compressed raster image, you can export a PSD to JPEG. You can also control quality settings to balance size and visual fidelity.

### How to Adjust Image Brightness
The API provides image‑adjustment classes that let you modify brightness, contrast, and gamma on a per‑layer or whole‑image basis without flattening the file.

### How to Add Layer Effects
You can programmatically add drop shadows, bevels, glows, and other Photoshop layer effects. This enables dynamic visual enhancements during runtime.

### How to Convert PSD to PDF
Exporting a PSD to PDF is useful for print‑ready documents or archival. The conversion retains vector text and layer information where possible.
